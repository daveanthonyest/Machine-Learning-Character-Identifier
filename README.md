# Handwritten Character Recognition (EMNIST + CNN)

## Overview
This project implements a **handwritten character recognition system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **EMNIST dataset**. The goal is to convert handwritten characters into digital text, focusing on **English letters (A–Z) and digits (0–9)**.

The project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a simple user interface for testing predictions.

## Motivation
Handwritten character recognition is a key component of **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** systems, which are widely used in:
- Education (digitizing handwritten notes)
- Banking (form and check processing)
- Healthcare (medical records)
- Automated data entry systems

This project explores how **deep learning**, specifically CNNs, can be applied to solve image-based classification problems.
